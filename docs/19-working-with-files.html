        <div class="markdown-content"><h2>working with files</h2>
<p>In the previous lesson we learned to work with file paths.<br />
thats good. because we can use that knowledge to work with files.</p>
<h3>Reading files</h3>
<p>Reading files is a fundamental operatin in many python programs. (and also in our company)<br />
<code>pathlib</code> provides convenient shorthand methods for reading files as eiter text or raw bytes.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pathlib import Path

file = Path(&quot;file.txt&quot;)

print(file.read_text())
</code></pre>
<p>This is a sample text</p>
<p>for binary files we use the <code>read_bytes()</code> method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pathlib import Path
image = Path(&quot;images/midjourney.png&quot;)

image.read_bytes()[:10]  # Display the first 10 bytes
</code></pre>
<p>Writing with pathlib is also easy. We can use the <code>write_text()</code> and <code>write_bytes()</code> methods.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pathlib import Path
file = Path(&quot;file.txt&quot;)

file.write_text(&quot;This is new text.&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>the thing with write_text is that it will overwrite the file if it already exists. <br />
now you can do python tricks ofcourse. first read the file.<br />
then append to the string. and write it back to the file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pathlib import Path

file = Path(&quot;file.txt&quot;)

old_text = file.read_text() + &quot;\n&quot;
final_text = &quot;This is the final text.&quot;

# Combine old and new texts and write them back
file.write_text(old_text + final_text)

print(file.read_text())
</code></pre>
<p>write bytes works the same way. </p>
<p>Even if Pathlib is a modern method i dont see many people using it.<br />
Therefor we shall learn the ways of working with reading and writing files with the <code>open()</code> function.</p>
<h2>working with files (the common way)</h2>
<p>The <code>open()</code> function is the most common way to read and write files in Python.<br />
It takes two arguments: the file path and the mode.</p>
<p>we can give the file path either as a string or as a <code>Path</code> object.<br />
the second argument is the mode we open a file in.</p>
<p>here are all the available modes to open a file in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 'r' | Open text file for reading. Raises an I/O error if the file does not exist. |
| 'r+' | Open the file for reading and writing. Raises an I/O error if the file does not exist. |
| 'w' | Open the file for writing. Truncates the file if it already exists. Creates a new file if it does not exist. |
| 'w+' | Open the file for reading and writing. Truncates the file if it already exists. Creates a new file if it does not exist. |
| 'a' | Open the file for writing. The data being written will be inserted at the end of the file. Creates a new file if it does not exist. |
| 'a+' | Open the file for reading and writing. The data being written will be inserted at the end of the file. Creates a new file if it does not exist. |
| 'rb' | Open the file for reading in binary format. Raises an I/O error if the file does not exist. |
| 'rb+' | Open the file for reading and writing in binary format. Raises an I/O error if the file does not exist. |
| 'wb' | Open the file for writing in binary format. Truncates the file if it already exists. Creates a new file if it does not exist. |
| 'wb+' | Open the file for reading and writing in binary format. Truncates the file if it already exists. Creates a new file if it does not exist. |
| 'ab' | Open the file for appending in binary format. Inserts data at the end of the file. Creates a new file if it does not exist. |
| 'ab+' | Open the file for reading and appending in binary format. Inserts data at the end of the file. Creates a new file if it does not exist. |

<pre><code class="language-python">f = open('zen_of_python.txt', 'r') 
print(f.read())
f.close()

    # The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
    # 
    # Beautiful is better than ugly.
    # Explicit is better than implicit.
    # Simple is better than complex.
    # Complex is better than complicated.
    # Flat is better than nested.
    # Sparse is better than dense.
    # Readability counts.
    # Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    # Although practicality beats purity.
    # Errors should never pass silently.
    # Unless explicitly silenced.
    # In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    # There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    # Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    # Now is better than never.
    # Although never is often better than *right* now.
    # If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    # If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    # Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

</code></pre>
<p>here we gave the file path as a common string.<br />
but we could have given it a <code>Path</code> object as well.<br />
and we chose the mode <code>r</code> to read the file.</p>
<p>in the example the <code>open()</code> function opens the text file in reading mode,<br />
allowing us to grab the information from the file without making changes to it.<br />
we then use the <code>read()</code> method to read the file.</p>
<p>the problem with opening a file like this is that we have to remember to close it.<br />
if we forget to close the file, it can cause memory leaks and other issues.<br />
and leaves open processes on the system.</p>
<p>to prevent this. the very smart people at python have created the <code>with</code> statement.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('zen_of_python.txt') as f:
    print(f.read())
print(&quot;i have closed the file handle&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>what this syntax does is that it automatically closes the file when the block of code is done.<br />
you should always use the with statement when working with files, sockets, and other resources that need to be closed.</p>
<p>in the example as soon as it leaves the block of code the file is closed.</p>
<p>in this syntax open('zen_of_python.txt') as f is the same as f = open('zen_of_python.txt') <br />
but with the added benefit of closing the file when the block is done.</p>
<p>working with the file can only be done is this block of code. but we can assign the content to a variable.<br />
so that we can use it a later point in the code.</p>
<p>all the methods that can be performed on a file object are:<br />
and with this i mean on the <code>f</code> variable above.</p>
<p>but there are many more file methods we can use.</p>
