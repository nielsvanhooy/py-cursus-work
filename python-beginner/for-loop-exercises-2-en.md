# Python Exercises

## Basic Exercises with if/elif/else, Boolean Conditions, Indexing, and Lists of Lists

### 1. Fruit Color Finder
- **Task:** 
- Create a list of fruits and their colors (list of lists). 
- Use a for loop to print the color of each fruit. 
- If the fruit is not in the list, print a message: "Sorry, I don't know that fruit."



### 2. Weather Checker
- **Task:** 
- Create a list of weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy, etc.). 
- Ask the user to enter today's weather, and print a message based on the weather. 
- Use `if/elif/else` to provide different messages depending on whether the weather is sunny, rainy, or snowy.



### 3. Favorite Foods with Boolean Conditions
- **Task:** Create a list of your favorite foods and ask the user to enter a food item. Use a boolean condition to check if the food item is in your list and print a message saying whether or not it's a favorite food.



### 4. Find the Index of a Fruit
- **Task:** Create a list of fruits. Ask the user to enter a fruit's name and use indexing to print the index of that fruit in the list. If the fruit is not found, print a message saying "Fruit not found."


### 5. Nested Lists â€“ Classroom Roll Call
- **Task:** Create a list of lists where each sublist contains the name of a student and their grade. Ask the user for a student's name and print the grade for that student. If the student is not found, print a message saying "Student not found."



## Intermediate Exercises with if/elif/else, Boolean Conditions, Indexing, and Lists of Lists

### 1. Library Book Search
- **Task:** Create a list of lists where each sublist contains a book title and its availability (True or False). Ask the user to input a book title and check if the book is available. Print a message saying whether the book is available or not.



### 2. Nested List Comparison
- **Task:** Create two lists of lists. The first list contains student names, and the second list contains their corresponding scores. Use a for loop and `if/elif/else` to compare each student's score to a passing grade (e.g., 60). Print a message for each student saying whether they passed or failed.
