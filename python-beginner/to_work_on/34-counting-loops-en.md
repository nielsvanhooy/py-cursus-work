# Counting loops

## Counting loops

This is how we can count from 0 to 9 in Python:

```py
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

The function call `range(10)` creates an object that behaves like the list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.

## Counting loops

typical variable name in counting loops: `i`

## Counting loops

2 x 7 = 14
3 x 7 = 21
4 x 7 = 28
