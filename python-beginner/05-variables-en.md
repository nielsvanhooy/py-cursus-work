# Variables

## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

```py
birth_year = 1970
current_year = 2020
age = current_year - birth_year
```

Names of variables are usually written in lower case, separating words by underscores

Variable names may only consist of letters, digits and underscores

## Variables

Overwriting (reassigning) variables:

```py
name = "John"
name = "Jane"
a = 3
a = a + 1
```

## Conventions

```py
NIELS_BIRTH_YEAR = 1987  # we call this a CONSTANT. because my birth year will never change
_current_year = 2025     # we call this a PRIVATE variable. it is not enforced by the language, but it is a convention for data the developer doenst want touched.
NIELS_BIRTH_YEAR_1987 = "1987" # we dont use numbers in variable names. this is a bad example.
```
