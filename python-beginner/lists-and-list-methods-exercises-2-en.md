## Important Tips:
1. Remember to use double square brackets: list[row][column]
2. First index selects the item, second index selects the property
3. You can store different types in the same inner list (strings, numbers, booleans)
4. Drawing the data as a table can help visualize the structure

## Practice Suggestions:
1. Predict what each piece of code will output
2. Try creating your own similar examples with different data
2. Practice with different data types in the inner lists

```
