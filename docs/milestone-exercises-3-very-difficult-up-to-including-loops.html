<p>These exercises are designed to practice the Python concepts you've learned so far, including:<br/>
- Variables and data types<br/>
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)<br/>
- Logical operators (and, or, not)<br/>
- Lists and list operations<br/>
- Lists of lists<br/>
- Loops (while and for)<br/>
- Input/output<br/>
- String manipulation</p>
<p>Each exercise builds upon the previous ones and increases slightly in difficulty.</p>

<p>Create a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.<br/>
1. Ask the user to choose conversion direction (F to C or C to F)<br/>
2. Ask for the temperature to convert<br/>
3. Display the converted temperature<br/>
4. Ask if they want to convert another temperature</p>
<h3 id="conversion-formulas">Conversion Formulas:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fahrenheit to Celsius: <code>C = (F - 32) * 5/9</code></li>
<li>Celsius to Fahrenheit: <code>F = (C * 9/5) + 32</code></li>
