## Lists

Lists are one of the most powerful data types in Python.
With some fictive data we are going to analyze data about mobile apps.


We will be working with this data:

| Name                      | Price | Currency | Rating Count | Rating |
|---------------------------|-------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Facebook                 | 0.0   | USD      | 2,974,676    | 3.5    |
| Instagram                | 0.0   | USD      | 2,161,558    | 4.5    |
| Clash of Clans           | 0.0   | USD      | 2,130,805    | 4.5    |
| Temple Run              | 0.0   | USD      | 1,724,546    | 4.5    |
| Pandora - Music & Radio | 0.0   | USD      | 1,126,879    | 4.0    |


We will call each value in the table a data point. 
For instance, the first row (after the column titles) has five data points:

- Facebook
- 0.0
- USD
- 2974676
- 3.5


lets call this collection of data a `dataset`.
our dataset has 5 rows and 5 columns.

With all the knowledge up to know we could store this data in variables like this:

```py
app_one_name = "Facebook"
app_one_price = 0.0
app_one_currency = "USD"
app_one_rating_count = 2974676
app_one_rating = 3.5
```

<details>
    <summary>Click to reveal more</summary>
<p>
The text "Facebook" as a string<br>
The price 0.0 as a float<br>
The text "USD" as a string<br>
The rating count 2,974,676 as an integer<br>
The user rating 3.5 as a float<br>
</p>
</details>

Creating a variable for each data point in our data set would be a cumbersome process. Fortunately, 
we can store data more efficiently using lists. 
This is how we can create a list of data points for the first row:

```py
row_one = ["Facebook", 0.0, "USD", 2974676, 3.5]
print(row_one)
type_row_one = type(row_one)
```

To create the `list` above, we:

Typed out a sequence of data points and separated each with a comma: 'Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5
Surrounded the sequence with brackets: `['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]`
After we created the list, we stored it in the computer's memory by assigning it to a variable named row_one.

To create a list of data points, we only need to:

Separate the data points with a comma.
Surround the sequence of data points with brackets.

## A note on lists

There are 2 ways to create an empty list in python:

- list()
- []

Functionally there the same. 
However there a speed tradeoffs and that is due to implementation details in the C compiler behind python.

To see the speed difference we can use the `timeit` module.
```py
from timeit import timeit

timeit("[]")
0.040084982867934334

timeit("list()")
0.17704233359267718
```
We can see that the `[]` is faster than the `list()` function. By a big margin.
content in a list is seperated by a comma.
Example:
```py
["item1", "item2", "item3"]
```

---
# Let's move on.
Now let's create five lists, one for each row in our dataset:

```py
row_one   = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
row_two   = ['Instagram', 0.0, 'USD', 2161558, 4.5]
row_three = ['Clash of Clans', 0.0, 'USD', 2130805, 4.5]
row_four  = ['Temple Run', 0.0, 'USD', 1724546, 4.5]
row_five  = ['Pandora - Music & Radio', 0.0, 'USD', 1126879, 4.0]
```

---
## Indexing python lists

A list can contain a variety of data types. A list like [4, 5, 6] has identical data types (only integers), 
while the list ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5] has mixed data types:

- Two strings ('Facebook', 'USD')
- Two floats (0.0, 3.5)
- One integer (2974676)

- The ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5] list has five data points. 
To find the length of a list, we can use the `len()` command we discussed earlier:

Example:

```py
row_one   = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
print(len(row_one))

list_one = [1, 2, 3]
print(len(list_one))

list_two = []
print(len(list_two))
```
Output would be:
- 5
- 3
- 0


For small lists, we can just count the data points on our screens to find the length, 
but the len() command will prove very useful whenever you work with lists containing many elements, 
or need to write code for data where you don't know the length ahead of time.


Each element (data point) in a list has a specific number associated with it, 
called an index number. The indexing always starts at 0, 
so the first element will have the index number 0, 
the second element the index number 1, and so on.

![indexing plaatje](img/lists-indexing.svg)

To quickly find the index of a list element, 
identify its position number in the list, and then subtract 1. 

For example, the string 'USD' is the third element of the list (position number 3), 
so its index number must be 2 since 3 - 1 = 2.

or what i find easier. just remember that the first element is 0 and the second is 1 and so on

The index numbers help us retrieve individual elements from a list. 
Looking back at the list row_one from the code example above, 

we can retrieve the first element (the string 'Facebook') with the index number 0 by running the code row_one[0].


```py
row_one = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
print(row_one[0])
```
Gives us the output: "Facebook"

The syntax for retrieving individual list elements follows the model `list_name[index_number]`. 

For instance, the name of our list above is row_one and the index number of the first element is 0 
â€” following the `list_name[index_number]` model, we get row_one[0], 
where the index number 0 is in square brackets after the variable name row_one.

![indexing plaatje 2](img/lists-indexing-two.svg)

This is how we can retrieve each element in row_one:

```py
row_one = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]

print(row_one[0])
print(row_one[1])
print(row_one[2])
print(row_one[3])
print(row_one[4])
```

output:

- Facebook
- 0.0
- USD
- 2974676
- 3.5

Retrieving list elements makes it easier to perform operations. 
For instance, we can select the ratings for Facebook and Instagram, 
and find the average or the difference between the two:


```py
row_one   = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
row_two   = ['Instagram', 0.0, 'USD', 2161558, 4.5]

difference = row_one[4] - row_two[4]
average_rating = (row_one[4] + row_two[4]) / 2

print(difference)
print(average_rating)
```
Output:

- 1.0
- 4.0


Let's use list indexing to extract the number of ratings from the first three rows 
and then average them:

```py
row_one   = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
row_two   = ['Instagram', 0.0, 'USD', 2161558, 4.5]
row_three = ['Clash of clans', 0.0, 'USD', 2130805, 4.5]

ratings_one = row_one[3]
ratings_two = row_two[3]
ratings_three = row_three[3]

total = ratings_one + ratings_two + ratings_three
average = total / 3

print(average)
```
Output

- 2422346.3333333335

# Negative Indexing

In Python, we have two indexing systems for lists:

- Positive indexing: the _first element has the index number 0, the second element has the index number 1, and so on.
- Negative indexing: the last element has the index number -1, the second to last element has the index number -2, and so on.

Negative indexing is a feature in Python that allows us to access elements from the end of a list.

here is an image to help you visually:

![indexing plaatje 3](img/lists-indexing-three.svg)

In practice, we almost always use positive indexing to retrieve list elements. 
Negative indexing is useful when we want to select the last element of a list.
especially if the list is long, and we can't tell the length by normal counting.

Example:

```py
row_one = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]

print(row_one[-1])
print(row_one[-4])
```
What do you think the output will be?
its the same number: 3.5

from the beginning we count 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
from the end we count -1, -2, -3, -4, -5

What would happend if you use an index that is out of range?

```py
row_one = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
print(row_one[5])

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range   <------------
```

Yes an IndexError!! so thats helpfull isn't it?

## Slicing Python Lists
---
# Syntax

`list_name[start : end : step]`

Parameters:

- start (optional): Index to begin the slice (inclusive). Defaults to 0 if omitted.
- end (optional): Index to end the slice (exclusive). Defaults to the length of list if omitted.
- step (optional): Step size, specifying the interval between elements. Defaults to 1 if omitted


---
Instead of selecting list elements individually, 
we can use a syntax shortcut to select two or more consecutive elements:

```py
row_three = ['Clash of Clans', 0.0, 'USD', 2130805, 4.5]

coc_pricing_data = row_three[0:3]
print(coc_pricing_data)
```

Output:

- `['Clash of Clans', 0.0, 'USD']`

When we select the first n elements (n stands for a number) from a list named a_list, 
we can use the syntax `shortcut a_list[0:n]`. 
In the example above, we needed to select the first three elements from the list row_three,
so we used `row_three[0:3]`.

When we selected the first three elements, 
we sliced a part of the list. 
For this reason, the process of selecting a part of a list is called list slicing.

There are many ways that we might want to slice a list:

![slicing plaatje 1](img/lists-slicing.svg)

To retrieve any list slice we want:

1. We first need to identify the first and the last element of the slice.
2. We then need to identify the index numbers of the first and the last element of the slice.
3. Finally we can retrieve the list slice we want by using the syntax `a_list[m:n]`, where:
    - m represents the index number of the first element of the slice; and
    - n represents the index number of the last element of the slice plus one (if the last element has the index number 2, then we n will be 3, if the last element has the index number 4, then n will be 5, and so on).

![slicing plaatje 2](img/lists-slicing-two.svg)



When we need to select the first or last x elements (x stands for a number), 
we can use even simpler syntax shortcuts:

- `a_list[:x]` when we want to select the first x elements.
- `a_list[-x:]` when we want to select the last x elements.

Example:

```py
row_three = ['Clash of Clans', 0.0, 'USD', 2130805, 4.5]
    
first_three = row_three[:3]
last_three = row_three[-3:]
```

Just know it exists. if you ever come across it you know what it does.

# List of lists

Python List of Lists
Previously, we introduced lists as a better alternative to using one variable per data point. 
Instead of having a separate variable for each of the five data points 'Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5, 
we can bundle the data points together into a list, and then store the list in a single variable.

So far, we've been working with a data set having five rows, 
and we've been storing each row as a list in a separate variable (the variables row_1, row_2, row_3, row_4, and row_5). 
If we had a data set with 5,000 rows, however, we'd end up with 5,000 variables, 
which will make our code messy and almost impossible to work with.

To solve this problem, we can store our five variables in a single list:

```py
row_one   = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
row_two   = ['Instagram', 0.0, 'USD', 2161558, 4.5]
row_three = ['Clash of Clans', 0,0, 'USD', 2130805, 4.5]
row_four  = ['Temple Run', 0.0, 'USD', 1724546, 4.5]
row_five  = ['Pandora - Music & Radio', 0.0, 'USD', 1126879, 4.0]

data_set = [row_one, row_two, row_three, row_four, row_five]
data_set

[
   ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5], 
   ['Instagram', 0.0, 'USD', 2161558, 4.5], 
   ['Clash of Clans', 0, 0, 'USD', 2130805, 4.5], 
   ['Temple Run', 0.0, 'USD', 1724546, 4.5], 
   ['Pandora - Music & Radio', 0.0, 'USD', 1126879, 4.0]
]
```
As we can see, data_set is a list that stores five other lists (row_1, row_2, row_3, row_4, and row_5). 
A list that contains other lists is called a list of lists.

The data_set variable is still a list, 
which means we can retrieve individual list elements and perform list slicing using the syntax we learned. Below, we:

- Retrieve the first list element (row_1) using data_set[0].
- Retrieve the last list element (row_5) using data_set[-1].
- Retrieve the first two list elements (row_1 and row_2) by performing list slicing using `data_set[:2]`.

```py
row_one   = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
row_two   = ['Instagram', 0.0, 'USD', 2161558, 4.5]
row_three = ['Clash of Clans', 0,0, 'USD', 2130805, 4.5]
row_four  = ['Temple Run', 0.0, 'USD', 1724546, 4.5]
row_five  = ['Pandora - Music & Radio', 0.0, 'USD', 1126879, 4.0]

data_set = [row_one, row_two, row_three, row_four, row_five]

print(data_set[0])
print(data_set[-1])
print(data_set[:2])


['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
['Pandora - Music & Radio', 0.0, 'USD', 1126879, 4.0]
[['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5], ['Instagram', 0.0, 'USD', 2161558, 4.5]]
```

We'll often need to retrieve individual elements from a list that's part of a list of lists â€” for instance, 
we may want to retrieve the value 3.5 from `['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]`, 
which is part of the data_set list of lists. 
Below, we extract 3.5 from data_set using what we've learned:

- We retrieve row_1 using data_set[0], and assign the result to a variable named fb_row.
- We print fb_row, which outputs ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5].
- We retrieve the last element from fb_row using fb_row[-1] (since fb_row is a list), and assign the result to a variable named fb_rating.
- Print fb_rating, which outputs 3.5

```py
row_one   = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
row_two   = ['Instagram', 0.0, 'USD', 2161558, 4.5]
row_three = ['Clash of Clans', 0,0, 'USD', 2130805, 4.5]
row_four  = ['Temple Run', 0.0, 'USD', 1724546, 4.5]
row_five  = ['Pandora - Music & Radio', 0.0, 'USD', 1126879, 4.0]

data_set = [row_one, row_two, row_three, row_four, row_five]

fb_row = data_set[0]
print(fb_row)

fb_rating = fb_row[-1]
print(fb_rating)

['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
3.5
```

Above, we retrieved 3.5 in two steps: we first retrieved data_set[0], 
and then we retrieved fb_row[-1]. 

However, there's an easier way to retrieve the same value of 3.5 by chaining the two indices ([0] and [-1]) â€” the code data_set[0][-1] retrieves 3.5:

![slicing plaatje 3](img/lists-slicing-three.svg)

Above, we've seen two ways of retrieving the value 3.5. 
Both ways lead to the same output (3.5), 
but the second way involves less typing because it elegantly combines the steps we see in the first case. 
While you can choose either option, people generally choose the second one.

## Python List Methods Reference Guide

## Adding Elements

### append()
Adds an element to the end of the list
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.append("orange")
# fruits is now ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
```

### extend()
Adds multiple elements from an iterable (list, tuple, etc.) to the end
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
more_fruits = ["orange", "grape"]
fruits.extend(more_fruits)
# fruits is now ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]
```

### insert()
Adds an element at a specific position
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.insert(1, "orange")
# fruits is now ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
```

## Removing Elements

### remove()
Removes the first occurrence of a specific value
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "grape"]
fruits.remove("apple")
# fruits is now ["banana", "apple", "grape"]
```

### pop()
Removes and returns an element at a specific index (or last element if no index given)
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "grape"]
last_fruit = fruits.pop()     # removes and returns "grape"
first_fruit = fruits.pop(0)   # removes and returns "apple"
```

### clear()
Removes all elements from the list
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "grape"]
fruits.clear()
# fruits is now []
```

## Finding Elements

### index()
Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "grape", "banana"]
banana_index = fruits.index("banana")    # returns 1
```

### count()
Returns the number of occurrences of a value
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "grape", "banana"]
banana_count = fruits.count("banana")    # returns 2
```

## Ordering Elements

### sort()
Sorts the list in place (modifies original list)
```py
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
numbers.sort()
# numbers is now [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]

# Sort with reverse order
numbers.sort(reverse=True)
# numbers is now [5, 4, 3, 1, 1]

# Sort strings
fruits = ["banana", "apple", "Cherry"]
fruits.sort()                 # Case-sensitive sort
# fruits is now ["Cherry", "apple", "banana"]

fruits.sort(key=str.lower)    # Case-insensitive sort
# fruits is now ["apple", "banana", "Cherry"]
```

### reverse()
Reverses the order of elements in place
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "grape"]
fruits.reverse()
# fruits is now ["grape", "banana", "apple"]
```

## Copying Lists

### copy()
Creates a shallow copy of the list
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "grape"]
fruits_copy = fruits.copy()
```

## Other Common Operations

### len()
Returns the length of the list (not a method, but a built-in function)
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "grape"]
length = len(fruits)    # returns 3
```

### in operator
Checks if an element exists in the list (not a method, but an operator)
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "grape"]
has_apple = "apple" in fruits    # returns True
```

## Advanced Usage Examples

### Combining Multiple Methods
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "grape", "banana", "cherry"]
# Remove last banana and insert orange in its place
last_banana_index = fruits.index("banana", fruits.index("banana") + 1)
fruits.pop(last_banana_index)
fruits.insert(last_banana_index, "orange")
```

### Using Methods with List Slicing
```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Replace middle elements with new values
numbers[1:4] = [8, 9, 10]
# numbers is now [1, 8, 9, 10, 5]
```

### Common Patterns
```py
# Remove duplicates while preserving order
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry"]
unique_fruits = list(dict.fromkeys(fruits))
# unique_fruits is ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Find all indices of an element
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "apple"]
apple_indices = [i for i in range(len(fruits)) if fruits[i] == "apple"]
# apple_indices is [0, 2, 4]
```

## Important Notes:
1. Most list methods modify the list in-place and return None
2. Methods like sort() and reverse() modify the original list
3. Python lists are zero-indexed
4. Lists can contain elements of different types
5. Lists are mutable (can be changed after creation)
