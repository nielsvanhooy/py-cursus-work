# Python: Overview

## Overview
---

- simple syntax, relatively easy to learn
- useful in many areas (science, web development, GUI programming)
- big standard library, many additional packages

## Python development and versions

Python 3: new minor version (e.g. 3.13) released every October

Python 2: support ended in 2019, [10% of developers](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2019/) were still using it by then

Our projects: Mix of 3.10, 3.11,3.12, 3.13    This is due that some packages have not yet been updated or deprecated.

## Code examples

```py
# this is a comment

a = 3
b = 4
print(a * b)

if a * b > 10:
    print('greater')
```
