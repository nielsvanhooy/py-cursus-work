# Functions

## Functions

A _function_ is a "sub-program" that can perform a specific task

examples of predefined functions:

- `len()` can determine the length of a string (or of a list, ...)
- `id()` can determine the internal ID of an object
- `type()` can tell us the type of an object
- `print()` can write some output into the terminal
- ...

## Functions

A function can receive so-called _parameters_ and produce a result (a _return value_)

example: `len()` can take a string as a _parameter_ and produce an int as the _return value_

example: `print()` can take various objects as _parameters_; it does **not** have an explicit _return value_

## Methods

A _method_ is a function that belongs to a specific object type (e.g. to _str_)

examples of string methods:

- `first_name.upper()`
- `first_name.count("a")`
- `first_name.replace("a", "@")`
