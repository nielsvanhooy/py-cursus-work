        <div class="markdown-content"><h1>Python Milestone Exercises</h1>
<p>These exercises are designed to practice the Python concepts you've learned so far, including:<br />
- Variables and data types<br />
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)<br />
- Logical operators (and, or, not)<br />
- Lists and list operations<br />
- Lists of lists<br />
- Loops (while and for)<br />
- Input/output<br />
- String manipulation</p>
<p>Each exercise builds upon the previous ones and increases slightly in difficulty.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Note these exercises can be really hard. The intention of these is to eventually be able to complete them.</h2>
<h2>If you can complete them. you will have mastery over the basics of python.</h2>
<h2>I think most will make it to exercise 3. for now. (we will get back later to them)</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Exercise 1: Temperature Converter</h2>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>Create a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.<br />
1. Ask the user to choose conversion direction (F to C or C to F)<br />
2. Ask for the temperature to convert<br />
3. Display the converted temperature<br />
4. Ask if they want to convert another temperature</p>
<h3>Conversion Formulas:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fahrenheit to Celsius: <code>C = (F - 32) * 5/9</code></li>
<li>Celsius to Fahrenheit: <code>F = (C * 9/5) + 32</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Starter Code:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python"># ===== EXERCISE 1: TEMPERATURE CONVERTER =====


print(&quot;=== TEMPERATURE CONVERTER ===&quot;)
print(&quot;Convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius!&quot;)

continue_converting = True

while continue_converting:
   # Get conversion direction
   print(&quot;\nConversion options:&quot;)
   print(&quot;1. Fahrenheit to Celsius&quot;)
   print(&quot;2. Celsius to Fahrenheit&quot;)

   # TODO: Check the user's choice and perform the appropriate conversion
   # ask for input
   # Remember to handle invalid input!

   # TODO: Ask if the user wants to convert another temperature
   # Set continue_converting to False if they don't

print(&quot;Thank you for using Temperature Converter!&quot;)

</code></pre>
<h2>Exercise 2: Word Counter</h2>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>Create a program that analyzes text input.<br />
1. Ask the user to enter a sentence or paragraph<br />
2. Count and display:<br />
   - Total number of characters<br />
   - Total number of words<br />
   - Average word length<br />
3. Ask if they want to analyze another text</p>
<h3>Hints:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>len()</code> to count characters</li>
<li>Use <code>string.split()</code> to split text into words</li>
<li>Calculate average word length by dividing total character count (excluding spaces) by word count</li>
</ul>
<h3>Starter Code:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python"># ===== EXERCISE 2: WORD COUNTER =====


print(&quot;=== WORD COUNTER ===&quot;)
print(&quot;Analyze text to count words and characters!&quot;)

analyze_again = True

while analyze_again:
   # Get text from user
   text = input(&quot;\nEnter a sentence or paragraph to analyze: &quot;)

   if text == &quot;&quot;:
     print(&quot;Please enter some text to analyze!&quot;)
     continue

   # TODO: Count the total number of characters

   # TODO: Count the number of words

   # TODO: Calculate the average word length

   # TODO: Display the results

   # TODO: Ask if the user wants to analyze another text
   # Set analyze_again to False if they don't

print(&quot;Thank you for using Word Counter!&quot;)

<h2>Exercise 3: To-Do List Manager</h2>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>Create a program that manages a simple to-do list.<br />
1. Display a menu with options<br />
2. Allow the user to add tasks with priority levels<br />
3. View tasks sorted by priority<br />
4. Mark tasks as completed<br />
5. View only completed or uncompleted tasks</p>
<h3>Hints:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a list of lists to store tasks: <code>[task_description, priority, completed]</code></li>
<li>For priority, use "High", "Medium", or "Low"</li>
<li>For completed status, use a boolean value (True/False)</li>
<li>Use the <code>sorted()</code> function with a key to sort tasks by priority</li>
</ul>
<h3>Starter Code:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python"># ===== EXERCISE 3: TO-DO LIST MANAGER =====
