# Python Exercises

## Basic Exercises

### 1. Create a Shopping List
- Create a list of items you want to buy. 
- Then, write a for loop to print out each item in the shopping list one by one. 
- Add a check to see if an item is in your list (for example, "milk") 
- and print "I already have milk!" if it's there.


### 2. Favorite Movies List
- Create a list of your favorite movies. 
- Write a for loop to print a message for each movie, 
- like: "I love watching movie name." 
- Modify the loop to print a special message for one movie (e.g., "The Lion King" should print "This is my all-time favorite movie!").


### 3. User-generated list

  this one is harder and will need something like range() to work

- Ask the user to enter 5 items into a list using the input() function. 
- Then, print each item entered by the user in a nice format using a for loop.


## Intermediate Exercises

### 4. Pet list

- Create a list of pets. 
- Use a for loop to print each petâ€™s name. 
- Then, write a part of the program that asks the user for a pet's name and checks if that pet is in the list (using `in`).


### 5. Guess the word

  hint: you need to :  import random   for this  (google for how to random something in python)

- Write a program where the computer randomly selects a word from a list of animals (e.g., "cat", "dog", "elephant"). 
- The user has to guess the word. 
- Each time the user guesses wrong, the program should print a hint (for example, the first letter of the word) and let them try again.
