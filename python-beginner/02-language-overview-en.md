# Python: Overview

## Python

- simple syntax, relatively easy to learn
- useful in many areas (science, web development, GUI programming)
- big standard library, many additional packages

## Python development and versions

Python 3: new minor version (e.g. 3.13) released every October

Python 2: support ended in 2019, [10% of developers](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2019/) were still using it by then

```py
# this is a comment

a = 3
